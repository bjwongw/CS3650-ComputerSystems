Our submissions are identical in both code and this report

1. What advantages and drawbacks does it have? How would you improve it if you
had more time?

    Advantages:
        We basically implmeneted the ext file system with hierarchical design.
    We're easily able to implement several step 2 features and programmed
    nicely to interfaces that kept most things clean and organized.
    
    Drawbacks:
        There is a lot of jumping arond and probably inefficient functions
    that could be simplified. We are limited to the number of files/
    directories that we can support, and not just because of the 1MB
    limitation. If we were to implement the >4K files, we would most
    likely have fragmented data around the file system.

    Improvements:
        We would like to support more metadata and larger files. It'd be
    nice to optimize our directory searches and lookups. We did a fairly
    brute-force method of achieving this.

2. What features did you complete? What is still missing? Did you implement
any additional functionality that wasn't required?

    We completed all of the step 1 features, as well as hard links, creating,
    deleting, and nesting directories, getting and updating timestamps.

    We're just missing reading/writing offsets and large files/directories.
